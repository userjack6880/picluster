# Module 4 - Sharing Storage

## Objective

**Setup an NFS shared file system**

While distributed filesytems (such as Lustre, GPFS, and others) are commonly used in clustered computing environments, [NFS (Network File System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) is still used for filesharing between systems within a network. Your objective is to create, format, and share a partition, along with two other pre-created filesystems, between all of the nodes within our cluster.

A few things you will need to know:

- There are two interactive users:
  - `admin` - this will be the user you will do administrative tasks with - this user has `sudo` access.
  - `user` - this will be an unprivileged user
  - both users have the same password - `tuxcluster`
- Your cluster will not have direct access to the internet. All packages you will need will be included on the pre-formatted drive.
- Your cluster will be accessible using a private IP range. The optional **'pi-hpc-terminal'** node will be configured to have an interface in this private range.
  - It is suggested that you use `10.0.0.101` with a subnet of `255.255.255.0` if you aren't using a Pi Zero terminal.
- The nodes will be assigned names and IP addresses as follows:
  - **pi-hpc-head01** - `10.0.0.2`
  - **pi-hpc-terminal** - `10.0.0.101`
  - **pi-hpc-compute[01-40]** - `10.0.0.11-50`
  - **pi-hpc-storage[01-40]** - `10.0.0.51-90`

All nodes are accessible via [`ssh`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh) using the `admin` user.

## Partitioning the Hard Drive

<span class="small">resources:
[fdisk](https://linux.die.net/man/8/fdisk)
</span>

First, you need to see what drives are installed on the head node. Log into **`pi-hpc-head01`** and issue the following command:

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

Take node of the disk you'll need to add a partition to. It'll be the (approximately) 120 GiB disk. If the output is, for example:

```
Disk /dev/sda: 119.24 GiB, 128035676160 bytes, 250069780 sectors
```

Then your disk is `/dev/sda`.

Now, we need to add the partition.

```
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

At this point, you can press `m` to view your options. The key ones you'll need for this objective, though, are:

- `n` : add a new partition
- `w` : write table to disk and exit

You will want to create a *primary* partition, it will be the third partition on the drive, and will go from the last free sector to the end of the disk. Essentially all default options.

Note: `fdisk` may complain about an existing filesystem signature on the partition - this is fine, as this system may have been reused and some residual partitioning signatures are left behind - acknowledge it and continue on.

## Creating a Filesystem

<span class="small">resources: 
[mke2fs](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mke2fs)
</span>

Creating an ext4 filesytem on linux is very straightforward.

```
sudo mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sda3
```

Make sure you specify the correct partition. If you are unsure, you can do a `sudo fdisk -l` and it should be the last device listed - approximately 60 GiB.

## Mounting the Filesystem

<span class="small">resources:
[mount points](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=mounting-mount-points),
[mkdir](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkdir),
[fstab](https://linux.die.net/man/5/fstab),
[blkid](https://linux.die.net/man/8/blkid),
[mount](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mount),
[chgrp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chgrp),
[chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod),
[ln](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ln)
</span>

Now that we have a filesystem on the third partition, we need to mount it. First, create a mount point:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/shared
```

Now, find the partition id of the partition - we will need this to add it to `/etc/fstab`.

```
sudo blkid /dev/sda3
```

The output should include a portion similar to `PARTUUID="6B728F42-03"`. Add this to `/etc/fstab` using `vim`. The line you will need to add will look like the ones above it, except with the partition id you just found. The `fstab` file lists all available disk partitions, file systems, and datasources and where they are mounted on the system's file structure.

Once you've added the new line, mount the file system:

```
sudo mount -a
```

You can check if the filesystem is mounted usng `df -h`. Now, we need to give users permission to add and remove files from this directory.

```
sudo chgrp users /mnt/shared
sudo chmod g+w /mnt/shared
```

Finally, to make it easier to access, create a symbolic link to this path in the root directory.

```
sudo ln -s /mnt/shared /shared
```

## Setup and Configure the NFS Server

<span class="small">resources:
[dpkg](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dpkg),
[systemctl](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html),
[exportfs](https://linux.die.net/man/8/exportfs)
</span>

While typically packages on a Debian-based system would be installed using `apt` or `apt-get`, we are working within an environment that does not have access to the network. All necessary packages are available under `/apps/pkgs`.

The first step will be to install the NFS server package.

```
sudo dpkg -i /apps/pkgs/nfs-kernel-server*.deb
```

Now, create the export entries in `/etc/exports` using `vim`

```
/home           10.0.0.0/24(rw,async,no_root_squash)
/mnt/apps       10.0.0.0/24(ro,async,no_root_squash)
/mnt/shared     10.0.0.0/24(rw,async,no_root_squash)
```

This will allow any computer in the `10.0.0.0` subnet (`10.0.0.1` - `10.0.0.254`) to mount the exported directories. `/mnt/apps` is exported as read only so that this path is preserved from accidental writing from computers that mount these directories.

Now, start and enable the NFS server:

```
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server
sudo systemctl start nfs-server
sudo systemctl status nfs-server
sudo exportfs -a
```

You should get an `active (exited)` status. At this point, `/home`, `/mnt/apps`, and `/mnt/shared` should be available to mount. Note: it seems that on these raspberry pi's that `showmounts -e` will cause it to hang.

If you want to make a change to `/etc/exports` after the NFS server has been started, you can set the new exports using `sudo exportfs -a`.

## Setup and Configure Clients

<span class="small">resources:
[rm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rm),
[ping](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ping)
</span>

The following will need to be done on all nodes (excluding **'pi-hpc-terminal'**) except the storage nodes - those will be preconfigured.

The first step will be to remove the local home directory for `admin`:

```
sudo rm -r /home/admin
```

This will prepare `/home` for the next steps.

Now, confirm if you can see the head node.

```
ping -c 2 pi-hpc-head01
```

This should return `2 packets transmitted` - this means you are able to see the head node. If you aren't able, check to make sure everything is plugged in correctly.

Create the /apps and /shared directories. You will need to use `sudo`. Once you've have done that, edit `/etc/fstab`:

```
pi-hpc-head01:/home         /home         nfs4    defaults,user,exec          0 0
pi-hpc-head01:/mnt/apps     /apps         nfs4    defaults,user,exec          0 0
pi-hpc-head01:/mnt/shared   /shared       nfs4    defaults,user,exec          0 0
```

Mount the shares using `sudo mount -a` and you should see the `pkgs` directory under `/apps` and a home directory for `user` under `/home`.
