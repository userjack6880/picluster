# About Pi HPC

Pi HPC is intended to be an instructional tool to help students new to the world of High Performance Computing through a series of modules that should guide them from a pile of hardware put in front of them to a working miniature compute cluster.

Pi HPC was developed by John Bradley and his students at the [Mississippi State University High Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPC2)](https://hpc.msstate.edu) for students at the university and is released to the public for all to benefit.
